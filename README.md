# Stockr

UPDATE: No longer working because Stocktwits does not allow scraping, and their API does not provide sentiment data.

Simple algorithm which scrapes Yahoo Finance and StockTwits for a current stock and presents a line graph with a 1y estimate and general bearish/bullish user predictions.

###### Usage
```
python scrape.py
```

Needs to be updated for StockTwits design changes.
